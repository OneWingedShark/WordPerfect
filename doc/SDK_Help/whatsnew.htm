    <h1>
        What's New?</h1>
    <p>
        The following is a basic log of changes to the WordPerfect Office SDK.</p>
    <h2>
        For X6</h2>
    <h3>
        GM</h3>
    <h4>
        Multiple Instances</h4>
    <p>
        Any Third-Party Handler (TPH) DLL that was originally written based on a prior version of the WordPerfect Office SDK if not updated before compiling will default
        to only load in the first launched instance of WordPerfect. Third party developers will need to implement the new TPHMultipleInstance() DLL-exported function to
        bypass this restriction. It is recommended that this new function be added to the Third-Party Handler DLL if, and only if, no runtime conflicts are anticipated.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Potential areas of conflict:
            <ul>
                <li>Registry access may return corrupt, incorrect or invalid results if the TPH DLL accesses it from within multiple versions of WordPerfect.</li>
                <li>Single-process designed databases accessed by the TPH may be locked in one instance, thereby preventing or blocking other instances from accessing the data correctly,
                    or in the worst case corrupt the database.</li>
                <li>TPH DLL will be unable to open files for read unless changed to use sharing semantics.</li>
                <li>TPH DLL will be unable to open files writing without sharing semantics. However, if using sharing flags, shared writing can cause file corruption unless proper
                    design is implemented for the file sharing.</li>
            </ul>
            <li>Note: The use of operating system synchronization mechanisms, such as mutexes, can help prevent such conflicts by the use of locking semantics.</li>
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        If you believe your DLL is ready for multiple instances of WordPerfect, the required changes are minimal.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Your DLL must implement the new <a href="Core/TPHMultipleInstance.html">TPHMultipleInstance()</a> function.
            <ul>
                <li>API passes in one parameter: the classname of the calling instance of WordPerfect. Note that each instance of WordPerfect now has a unique classname, not simply
                    'WordPerfect.xx.00' (where 'xx' is the current version number). The classname should be saved internally for later use, as it is typically used in conjunction with
                    a Win32 'FindWindow' call to get an HWND handle from WordPerfect.</li>
            </ul>
            <li>Be sure, of course, to test your DLL while running under multiple instances of WordPerfect, to ensure that changes made to one instance do not unintentionally interfere
                with other instances.</li>
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        The sample TPHs shipped with the new SDK will contain sample implementations and additional relevant information.</p>
    <h4>
        Versioning Independence</h4>
    <p>
        The new WordPerfect Office X6 SDK will allow TPH DLLs to work with versions X4 and later of WordPerfect without recompilation of the third-party developer's code.
        As a result:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>If you have hard-coded checks for version numbers, you can leave the minimum version number at 15 (last version compiled, but no earlier than X4).</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>
        SDK Documentation</h4>
    <p>
        Documentation has been revised and added to the provided SDK help. See the new <a href="Core/SDK_TOC.html">Table Of Contents</a> to see
        the additional documentation.</p>
    <h2>
        For X5</h2>
    <h3>
        GM</h3>
    <p>
        New versions of the token-calling functions were created to solve a re-entrancy issue caused by using global variables when sending of tokens to WordPerfect.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>InitTkn() will be deprecated in a future version of the WordPerfect Office SDK in favor of InitTkn_().</li>
        <li>AddTknParm() will be deprecated in a future version of the WordPerfect Office SDK in favor of AddTknParm_().</li>
        <li>SendTkn() will be deprecated in a future version of the WordPerfect Office SDK in favor of SendTkn_().</li>
        <li>FreeTkn() will be deprecated in a future version of the WordPerfect Office SDK in favor of FreeTkn_().</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>
        SP1</h3>
    <p>
        The WordPerfect Office X5 SDK Service Pack 1 includes changes since the GM version.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Fixes for Delphi projects and versioning
            <ul>
                <li>Fixed issues with X5 versions of Delphi examples for Third-Party Handler DLL for WordPerfect.</li>
                <li>Re-added utility for creating link to sample Customer (SetSdkAlias.exe) in Samples\DB</li>
                <li>Fixed issues with third-party DLL working with multiple versions of WordPerfect.</li>
                <li>Fixed issue in WpFormat.dll - original release for X5 created incorrect packing of structures within file format (DelphiOle example)</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ul>
