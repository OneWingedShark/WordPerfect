    <p>Corel Corporation is pleased to provide you with this SDK for WordPerfect Office.
    In designing this latest version of the SDK, it was the intention of Corel Corporation

    purpose. The SDK is provided to software developers with the expectation that the developers
    are capable of writing and debugging their own programs; Corel Corporation does not
    assume any support obligations with respect to the SDK or the use thereof. Any research,
    development, or evaluation you perform is done entirely at your own risk.</p>
